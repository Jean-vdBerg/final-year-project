# final-year-project

Repository storing the Android code for my final year project in studying Computer Engineering.

The project aims to build an Android application with built in speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality that is either done using the IBM API or with self written code. The application aims to allow users to use voice commands to send/receive both texts and e-mails.
